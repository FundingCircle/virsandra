# Virsandra

The Cassandra backed models with Virtus gem with a stupid name.

## Moving target

Virsandra is meant to make it easy to use cassandra for persistence
for models build with virtus.

The feature set will likely remain simple, the idea is to not block
development of other projects while the implentation of CQL changes
quickly.
